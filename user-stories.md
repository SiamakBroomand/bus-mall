Story 1: Marketing Manager analyzes the research result

As a Marketing Manager I want to be able to tell from the image click
result which product has the most interest from customer so that I can
tell my client which product they should place in the catalog.


Story 2: Developer writes program to keep track of customers' interest

As a Developer I want to write program that displays the product
images randomly in a group of 3 and keeps track of the number of
times each image was clicked has after the image group (of 3) has been displayed
for a total of 25 times so that the Marketing Manger can do his/her task.


Story 3: Focus Group Participant partipates in the research

As a Focus Group participant I want to click on the image of the
product that I would be interested in purchasing so that the Marketing
Manager can use this data to tell client which product to market.
